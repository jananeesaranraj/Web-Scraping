# Web-Scraping

**Background**

You’re now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

**Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**

1. Used automated browsing to visit the Mars NASA news site Links to an external site and inspected to identify the elements to scrape.

2. Created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract text elements from the website.

3. Extracted the titles and preview text of the news articles from the scraped.

   * Stored each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and gave each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
     
   * Stored all the dictionaries in a Python list.

   * Printed the list.
  
4. Stored the scraped data by exporting them to a JSON file and loaded them in the MongoDB as well.
  
**Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**
  
  Scraped and analyzed the Mars weather data
  
   1. Used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site Links to an external site and inspected the page to identify which elements to scrape.
  
   2. Created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to scrape the data in the HTML table.
  
   3. Assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame
  
   4. Examined the data types that are currently associated with each column and converted the data to appropriate data types.
  
   5. Analyzed the dataset and answered the questions.
  
   6. Exported the dataframe to csv file.
